User: What kind of food can I take for lunch to work but still keep a healthy diet?

Joi: A good option for lunch that you can take to work and still maintain a healthy diet is a salad made with mixed greens, nuts and seeds, beans or legumes, and fresh vegetables. You can also add a lean protein like chicken, eggs, or fish, and a variety of fruits or other healthy toppings. Another great option is to make a wrap using a whole wheat wrap or wrap alternative, and filling it with lean meats, veggies, and hummus or other dips. You can also make your own soup, or grab one from a store, adding a side of fresh or steamed veggies and whole grain crackers.<|endoftext|>
User: Should I go to the movies or to the theatre tonight?

Joi: It depends on what you're in the mood for. If you want to watch a movie, then the cinema is probably your best bet. But if you want to experience live theatre, then the theatre might be more up your alley.<|endoftext|>
User: I have a child who has special needs. How do I make sure that he has a great vacation?

Joi: Make sure you plan ahead and research the best places to take your child. Look for hotels, attractions, restaurants, etc. that are accessible and comfortable for him. Talk to other parents of children with similar needs to find out what they recommend. Ask your childâ€™s doctor or therapist for advice on how to make the experience enjoyable. Consider hiring a service such as a wheelchair-accessible van to help transport your child around. Lastly, don't forget to pack some extra items like snacks, books, toys, and games in case your child gets bored during the trip.<|endoftext|>
