It holds that all forms of government are undesirable and harmful, and that they should be replaced by a society in which individuals cooperate voluntarily in a free market.\t I believe that a state of anarchy is the best system. I believe that it is the only system that works. The reason is that there is no way to solve problems without a government. It is impossible to create a system that will not have problems. The only way to solve problems is to create a government. This is the case because people will always have different ideas about what should be done and what should not be done. Without a government, these problems cannot be solved.\n",
